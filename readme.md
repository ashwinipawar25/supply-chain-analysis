## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a complete Supply Chain Analysis built as a client project using Python, Power BI, and Excel. The objective is to analyze end‑to‑end supply chain performance and present insights through interactive dashboards and a comparison report across different product types.

The project demonstrates practical skills required for a Data Analyst role, including data extraction from a database, data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and business storytelling.



## 📌Project Objectives
*  Perform a diagnostic analysis of supply chain operations<br>

* Compare supply chain performance across different product types<br>

* Analyze revenue, costs, defects, lead times, logistics, and suppliers<br>

*  Build executive‑level dashboards for decision‑making<br>

*  Present insights in a clear, business‑friendly manner<br>

## Dataset Description

* The dataset contains detailed supply chain information, including:

* Product & Sales Data (Product type, SKU, Price, Revenue, Sales volume)

* Inventory & Production (Stock levels, Production volumes, Manufacturing costs)

* Logistics & Shipping (Shipping time, shipping cost, carriers, transportation modes)

* Supplier & Quality Metrics (Supplier name, defect rates, inspection results)

* Location‑based metrics (Supplier location, routes, lead times)


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

1 .Microsoft Excel – Initial data understanding & validation<br>
2. Python (Basic) – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis<br>
3. Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard create<br>
